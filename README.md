# Tutorials
This repository just stores all the code I write that is related to the tutorials I take. Most of it it's me typewriting the instructions, so generally it is not my original work. Instead of creating a repository for each tutorial, I create a branch for each tutorial, and this repo alone joins everything. The reason is not to polute my GitHub with stuff that it is not mine.

The branches names are organized in <author/project>.
